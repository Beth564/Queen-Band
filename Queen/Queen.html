 <div>
   <p class="font2">Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and later joined by John Deacon (bass).
    <br>
    Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock. The band's 1977 album <b>News of the World</b> contained <b>"We Will Rock You"</b> and <b> "We Are the Champions"</b>, which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. <b>"Another One Bites the Dust" </b> from The Game (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album <b>Greatest Hits</b> is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified nine times platinum in the US. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Though he kept his condition private, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. The band released two more albums, <b>The Miracle</b> in 1989 and <b>Innuendo</b> in 1991. On 23rd November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed that he had AIDS, and the next day died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury's vocal, 1995's <b>Made in Heaven</b>. John Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004 they have toured as "Queen +", with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.

    <p>
      Freddie Mercury was a British singer and songwriter, who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen.
      Mercury was know for his flamboyant stage persona and four octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman
      with his threatricial style, influencing the artisitic direction of Queen. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including <b>"Killer Queen"</b>, 
      <b>"Bohemian Rhapsody"</b>, <b>"Somebody to Love"</b>, <b>"We Are the Champions"</b>, <b>"Don't Stop Me Now"</b> and <b>"Crazy Little Thing Called Love"</b>.
      <br>
      <br>
     Mercury was disgnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and posthumously featured on their final album,
      <b>"Made in Heaven"</b> (1995). In 1991, the day after announcing his diagnosis, he died from
      complications of the disease, at the age of 45.
      In 1992, a concert in tribute to him was held at wembely stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness.

     one of the most succesful acts in music history.
     <br>
     <br>
     As a memeber of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician, identified with distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often
     using home-built electric guitar called the Red Special. May wrote numerous hits for Queen, including <b>"We Will Rock You</b>, <b>"I Want It All"</b>,
     <b>"Fat Bottomed Girls"</b>, <b>"Flash"</b>, <b>"Hammer To Fall"</b>, <b>"Save Me"</b>, <b>"Who Wants To Live Forever"</b>, <b>"Too Much Love Will Kill You"</b>, and

     "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor 
     for further performances featuring other vocalists.

    particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, 
    Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass guitar, Deacon played some guitar, 
    keyboards and piano on Queen's studio work.

    After the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991 and the following year's Tribute Concert, Deacon
